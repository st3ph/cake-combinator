cake-combinator
===============

A helper for combining and compressing CSS and JS in Cake 1.2 and 1.3

This combinator was originally developed by [St3ph](https://github.com/st3ph).
More info can be found at his weblog: <http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/st3ph/2010/09/10/combinator-compress-and-combine-your-js-and-css-files>.

I added it to GitHub including my own additions.
